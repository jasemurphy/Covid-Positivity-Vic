# Covid-Positivity-Vic

This is an animated chart I made to try to understand the relationship between testing numbers and 
case numbers for covid in the state of Victoria, in Australia.

Causation is hard to figure out! As case numbers rise, people get tested more. And as you test more you find more cases.

It is not always obvious what the effect of extra testing would be. Who are the marginal test-takers? 
and how covid positive are they compared to the average test-taker??
